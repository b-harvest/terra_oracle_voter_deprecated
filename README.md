# Terra_oracle_voter
Oracle autovoting script for Terra(v0.3.0+) oracle by B-Harvest

## Disclaimer
The script is in highly experimental state, and users should aware that all result from the terra_oracle_voter script is responsible to the user himself/herself.

## Language
Python3.8 Recommended

## Preliminary
The server running this script should run terrad with synced status.

## New features
1) error handling
- when coinone price, last swap price, or fx rate is unavailable, vote -1 for all oracle
- when coinone bid-ask spread is wider than `bid_ask_spread_max`, vote -1 for all oracle
- when other exchange price than coinone is unavailable, exclude those prices from averaging
- when calculated oracle price and last oracle price differ more than `stop_oracle_trigger_recent_diverge`, vote -1 for the denom
2) period-customized vwma(volume weighted moving average) for coinone market price
3) customized weights for each exchange's market price
4) use LCD endpoint to get recent oracle prices

* Thank you Peter(ChainLayer.io) for reviewing and testing the script!

### Systemctl
Copy the oracle.service file to /etc/systemd/system and change the location of the working directory and oracle file accordingly
enable the service with systemctl enable oracle
start the service with systemctl start oracle
